# Vanishing Cage
A simple C# application for converting a RoomEQWizard.txt to a .peace file. 

The two programs i interface with are 

Room EQ Wizard and PEACE “Peters Equalizer APO Configuration Extension”

For my dad's audio project.

# TODO
• After a user has drag-and-dropped the input file to the GUI, ask them for a preferred directory to save too.
    if not given or does not exist -> create directory and save .peace file to c:\Users\Public\PeaceConverter 

• Create msi installer -> if we can get admin privledges we can install to C:\Program Files\ ... for other things

• Add minimize to tray functionality?
    Add favicon for program/tray icon caged bird
    
• Right-click menu integration in windows explorer.
    Allow a user to right-click a text file and send it to my converter.
    
• GUI enhancements
    make not resizeable, add a place for a user to search for the file through a file browser, show that the user can     drag-and-drop a file onto the GUI as well, aesthetic changes(Name of my program in large letters, a dotted line     around some text/white space saying "drag and drop target file here" and then have "or browse your pc for it" with a     built in file browser)?

• Theme Look & Feel
Caged bird theme - black and creme color scheme
